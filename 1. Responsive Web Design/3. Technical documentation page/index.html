			<p>Minecraft is a game about bringing the most out of your creativity. Moreover, creativity in this game can be
				understood from different perspectives: building, PvP, redstone engineering, and at the end of the list we
				have what I like to call "command block programmers" or "function programmers" as of now.</p>
			<p>With this out of the way, we are going to dive into the basics of Minecraft commands and how many impressive
				things you can do with them when used together correctly. There are many more commands that are being used
				less in contraptions, so this page will at least help you not only get into the principles of this
				pseudo-programming language, but what commands you can use to lay your foundation with.</p>

			<header class="section-header">What are 'datapacks'?</header>
			<p>Datapacks are a more recent addition (first added in the 1.13 version of the game) that allow players to
				further customize their experience within the game. A datapack takes the form of a folder that inhabits
				special text files that use the .mcfunction extension.</p>
			<p>More briefly, a datapack is a bundle of <u>functions</u> that can be executed based on how you configure it.
				Functions are, simply put, text files that contain one command per line. Here is an example of how a
				.mcfunction file usually looks like:</p>
			<code>
	      <div>
	        teleport @s ~ ~5 ~<br/>
	        setblock ~ ~-1 ~ emerald_block<br/>
	        execute at @s run setblock ~ ~-1 ~ diamond_block<br/>
	      </div>
	    </code>
			<p>Files within a datapack must have a certain structure:</p>
			<code>
	      <pre>
	(data pack name)
	    pack.mcmeta
	    data
	        (namespace)
	            functions
	                (function).mcfunction
	            tags
	                functions
	                    (tag).json
	      </pre>
	    </code>

		<section class="main-section" id="Target_selectors">
			<header class="section-header">Target selectors</header>
			<p>Now that you know how minecraft command programmers (MCPs for short) bundle their commands in an organized,
				up to date manner, it's time we dive into a well-used parameter: target selectors. </p>
			<p>Target selectors allow you to refer the command you use to one entity (players, mobs, items, etc.) or a group
				of entities. As of writing this documentation, there are 5 types of target selectors:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>@p - Target the nearest player relative to the location of the command executor. Only works on player
					entities</li>
				<li>@r - Targets a random player. Only works on player entities as well</li>
				<li>@a - Targets all players that are online at the moment of execution. Like the previous two, only works
					for player entities</li>
				<li>@s - Targets the entity that executed the command.</li>
				<li>@e - Targets everything that is considered an entity. <a
						href="https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/entity_list_pc.php" target="_blank">See the list of all
						entities in Minecraft</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>What makes target selectors so used, though, is that you can provide additiona arguments to them, making the
				selection more accurate. Arguments like <code class="c">type</code>, <code class="c">tag</code> or <code
					class="c">nbt</code> are used the most by mapmakers to query targets with specific, desired states. Here
				is an example of a command that uses target selector arguments to teleport all creepers to the command
				executor:</p>
			<code>
	      <div>
	        tp @e[type=creeper] @s<br/>
	      </div>
	    </code>
			<p><a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands#Target_selector_variables" target="_blank">See the
					wikipedia page for an in-depth look at target arguments</a></p>

			<header class="section-header">What you should avoid doing</header>
			<p>Using these commands can be fun, but using them irresponsibly might as well impact your minecraft world
				negatively the same they can positively.</p>
			<p>Here are some measures you should have in mind when creating a datapack for your world:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Make sure you refer to a small volume of entites. For example, using just one or no arguments with @e
					will increase the running time, as @e selects ALL entities and there is a big chance your world is
					inhabited by lots of them</li>
				<li>The order of your target selector arguments slightly affect the execution time. Certain arguments have a
					slightly bigger intensivity, like <code class="">type</code>, so when you use selectors, be as specific
					as you can</li>
				<li>Use the <code class="c">nbt</code> argument mindfully. This argument queries the NBT of an entity,
					therefore it can affect run time. Try replacing this argument with <a
						href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Predicate" target="_blank">predicates</a> when possible.</li>
			</ul>

		<section class="main-section" id="The_/scoreboard_command">
			<header class="section-header">The /scoreboard command</header>
			<p>The <code class="c">/scoreboard</code> command is meant for creating, you guessed it, scoreboards!
				Scoreboards can display different statistics in your world or store numerical values, on the middle-right
				side of your screen.</p>
			<p>"How is this command useful to a mapmaker?" you might ask? As mentioned, scoreboards are generally used as
				variable storers. Minecraft was never meant to be a programming environment, but the quick-witted people of
				the community gave scoreboards a significant purpose in their projects.</p>
			<p>This command comes with many parameters, such as <code class="c">objective</code> for managing the
				scoreboards themselves, or <code class="c">players</code> for managing the content of scoreboards, such as
				player scores. An interesting application mapmakers have, that not many know about, is that scoreboards
				accept "fake" players as well, thing that opens the possibility of having constants or variables to work
				with. Here is an example of how to create one:</p>
			<code>
	      <pre>
	<span class="comment"># This command creates a scoreboard called "variables"</span>
	scoreboard objectives add variables dummy
	<span class="comment"># And this one creates a fake player named "cookiesEaten" by adding a hashtag before the name and assigning it with the number 6</span>
	<span class="comment"># !! Only integers are accepted !!</span>
	scoreboard players set #cookiesEaten variables 6
	      </pre>
	    </code>
			<p><a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Scoreboard" target="_blank">See the wikipedia page for an in-depth
					look at scoreboards</a></p>

		<section class="main-section" id="The_/execute_command">
			<header class="section-header">The /execute command</header>
			<p>Finally, this command, in my opinion, is a must-have in any datapack you create. Without it, not many
				astonishing things can be created, it is THAT important! The <code class="c">/execute</code> command's inner
				workings are so complicated that explaining everything here would be too lenghty.</p>
			<p>The official minecraft wikipedia page describes <code class="c">/execute</code> as a <i>"versatile command
					that modifies variables or procedures in the execution of another command."</i>. What it means is that
				you can take a command and execute it, for example, from another entity's perspective (location, the
				direction it's facing, etc). What makes it such a golden command is the fact that it can used in conjunction
				with target selectors, which allows for precise selection and versatility, just how the wikipedia page
				describes it as.</p>
			<p>Here is an example of how you can pull a devious prank on your friends with the <code
					class="c">/execute</code> command:</p>
			<code>
	      <pre>
	<span class="comment"># Summons a creeper that will explode instantly relative to all players except you</span>
	execute as @a[distance=1..] at @s run summon creeper ~ ~ ~ {Fuse:1}
	      </pre>
	    </code>
			<p>This command has many parameters that allows for full control over the execution. <a
